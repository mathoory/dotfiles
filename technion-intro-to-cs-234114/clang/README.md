# clang

##Enforcing the following guidelines:

###clang-tidy:
* Max method statements: 13 lines (doesn't 100% match course guidelines, but as close as we can get.)
* No magic numbers allowed
* macros (defines) are UPPER_CASE
* allowed headers according to exercise
* disabled checks for unsafe functions such as scanf
* disabled declaration isolation (saves lines of code)
* disabled initialize checks (personal preference)

###clang-format:
* Column width: 75
* Indentation: tab width is 4, never use tabs
* Always breaks before braces (personal preference)
